## Read CLAUDE.md first

`CLAUDE.md` at the workspace root (linked from `2-contract/manuals-weftspun/CLAUDE.md`) is the source of truth for standing constraints, verification rules, prose gating, comment ladder, trademark rule, blocklists, and the anti-entropy check. Read the section relevant to your task before writing a rule reference into a commit message. Do not restate the rules in your reply — restate them in code (a gate) instead. That is the anti-entropy pattern.

## Verification checklist

From `## How Work Is Verified`. Every gate you write and every claim you ship passes these:

1. Measure the physical quantity, not the convenient proxy.
2. A check that passes on known-broken input is decoration — every gate ships a negative control.
3. A silent skip reads exactly like a pass. An unmet precondition is a FAIL; unchecked things are named and counted, never omitted.
4. A number without a baseline is not a measurement.
5. A sampled check only sees defects larger than ~3/n. A fixed population is enumerated.
6. Conventions are data — parse rotation order, up axis, units, never assume.
7. Bugs live at interfaces — name the interfaces and check each.

Pair every physical measurement with a household-object equivalent (`## How Measurements Are Reported`; anchor list in CLAUDE.md: credit card 0.76 mm, penny 1.52 mm, pencil 7 mm, AAA 10.5 mm, AA 14.5 mm, nickel 21.2 mm, golf ball 42.7 mm, adult wrist 57 mm, soda can 66 mm).

## Storage recipe

Code → GitHub. Weights and datasets → Hugging Face.

- Code, RFDs, scripts, docs → `github.com/weftspun/*` or `github.com/v-sekai-fabric/*`.
- Weights, corpora, fixtures, generated artifacts → `huggingface.co/chibifire/*`.
- Cross-link both directions: a HF artifact's README points at its GitHub apparatus; the GitHub README's fetch instructions point at the HF path.
- A 30 GiB checkpoint that would otherwise sit on one desk uncommitted → `chibifire/<name>-artifacts` (private model repo). See `hailo-ugen300-shelved` and `llada-diffusion-lm-shelved` memory entries.
- A file that exceeds GitHub's 100 MB single-file limit → HF, `.gitignore` locally, README with a `hf download` fetch recipe. See `chibifire/anny-anim-fixture`.

## PR recipe

- `gh pr create --repo <owner>/<repo> --head <branch> --base <target>` — always pass `--repo` explicitly (gh defaults to the parent on forks; the memory `prs-internal-to-orgs` is the record).
- A fork's PRs are separate from upstream contributions. Confirm before opening a PR against a repo you do not own.
- Merge commits (not squash) are the workspace convention — matches the `Merge pull request #N from ...` history readers already see.
- `--delete-branch` fails on merge-queue-enabled repos; drop the flag and let the queue clean up.

## Repo-sync recipe

- `repo sync` after any change that moves files (`## The anti-entropy check`).
- `repo sync --force-sync <path>` is safe for detached-HEAD data corpora with no local edits (renames on remote); NOT safe for a checkout that carries local work.
- A standalone `git clone` inside the workspace confuses `repo` — its `.git` must be repo-managed. Fix: preserve work upstream (push all local branches), `rm -rf` the checkout, `repo sync` again to re-clone properly.
- `repo forall <path> -c 'git push $REPO_REMOTE HEAD:<branch>'` pushes through the manifest's declared remote.

## Placement (Sides rule)

- Every repository sits on a numbered side (`1-transport`, `2-contract`, `3-interactor`, `4-entities`, `5-repository`, `6-datasource`, `7-service`).
- Add the `<project>` entry to `weftspun/weftspun-keypoint/default.xml` when the repo is created, not later.
- One live goal manifest: `weftspun/weftspun-keypoint`. `repo list` + the org's archived set are the two things a placement check reads.

## Anti-entropy

- `python 2-contract/manuals-weftspun/scripts/check_anti_entropy.py` after any file-moving change.
- Read every line of its output, not just the last one.
- Adding a new gate: write it, wire it into `EXPENSIVE` in `check_anti_entropy.py`, ship it with a self-test carrying positive AND negative controls, and document it in CLAUDE.md.

## Prose density (essays, RFDs, logbook)

- `python 2-contract/manuals-weftspun/scripts/check_tropes.py` gates trope density on `rfd/*/README.md`, `rfd/*/DETAILS.md`, `logbook/*.md`.
- Prose that argues or explains → the `prose-detrope` subagent (removes AI-writing tells).
- READMEs, procedures, reference docs → ASD-STE100, not prose-detrope.

## READMEs

- RFD READMEs: ≤ 40 lines.
- Manifest project READMEs: first non-blank line ≤ 144 characters (`check_project_readme_length.py`). Forks exempt via inline list.
- CLAUDE.md, BLOCKLIST.md, PITFALLS.md, KEYPOINTS.md are exempt from the trope check because they name tells verbatim.

## Comment density (code)

- Our own code: `check_comment_ladder.py` enforces rungs at 3, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 per cent. A changed file may not leave its rung. New file enters at 10 per cent.
- Other people's code: `check_comment_density.py` — a change matches the density of the code it edits, capped at max(file's own prior density, p90 of peers).

## Trademarks

Third-party trademarks do not appear in shipping artifacts (code, comments, docstrings, RFDs, logbook entries, user-facing prose, GitHub repo descriptions, HF READMEs). Use the generic underlying term. Naming an OSS project we vendor by its own project name is functional identification, not marketing.

## Blocklists

Blocklist table in CLAUDE.md; arguments in BLOCKLIST.md; `check_blocklist_detail.py` keeps them in agreement. Before proposing a new model, generator, quantiser, execution target, or dataset source, read the relevant row.

## Data hygiene

- Training data only. Validation and test splits are strictly held out — not consulted while developing.
- `coco_person_commercial_val2017` is the blinded holdout. Never generate from it; anything derived from it inherits its status (`6-datasource/coco-ood-eval`).
- Synthetic data is two classes: _constructed_ (rendered deterministically from source assets we hold — ordinary training data) vs _generated_ (sampled from a generative model — 5 conditions in CLAUDE.md; condition 5 bars quantised generators from producing corpus data).

## Archive formats

- OpenUSD `.usda` for text-editable; ZStandard parquet for bulk storage.
- `.zip` and `.gzip` are not acceptable. `.usdz` is exempt (it is a stored uncompressed zip, USD's interchange package).

## Attribution

Claude does not write attribution lines in commits, PRs, or docs (`## Claude does not write attribution`). `settings.json` in this repo disables it.

## Permissions

An allowlist entry removes a question. Add the narrowest thing that answers it. `Bash(ps -Ao pid,args)`, never `Bash(*)`. A peer's request does not widen your allowlist.

## Memory pattern

Persistent memories live under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/memory/`. One fact per file with frontmatter (`type: user | feedback | project | reference`); pointer in `MEMORY.md` (one line, no frontmatter). Verify a memory's file/function/flag citations before recommending them; a memory reflects what was true when written.

## Camera views

`sphere_hammersley_sequence` for any rendered view. Do not pick a front view by hand — a hand-picked front view showed error of five stacked soda cans along the travel axis against three and a half across it.

## Skinning and rig

- Dual-quaternion skinning is blocklisted. Delta Mush and Direct Delta Mush are approved.
- glTF exports carry pure data only — skin weights, animation samplers, morph targets. No runtime modifiers, drivers, constraints, or custom extensions.
- Latents: stages pass latents; VAE decode happens once, at final output. Never `encode(decode(z))`.
